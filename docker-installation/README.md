This is a [script](https://github.com/samaneharia/scripts/tree/edit/docker-installation)for installing ***docker*** and ***docker-compose*** on ubuntu systems
Also your user (if it is not root) will be added to the docker group so you
do not need to use sudo for docker commands.

If you see docker and docker-compose version at the end,this means that the 
script has been executed succesfully.
